{adjective} {animal} {verb1} down the hallway. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3}
right in front of my family. {noun.capitalize()} was surprise to see me holding 
{number} {thing}. It was then when I remember I had to {verb4}.''')
